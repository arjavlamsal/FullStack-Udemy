<!-- When a user submits the form, the data is sent to your Node.js server at the "/check" endpoint, triggering the passwordCheck middleware you implemented earlier. The middleware checks if the password matches "ILoveProgramming" and sets userIsAuthenticated accordingly. -->

  <!-- When the form is submitted, it will send a POST request to the "/check" endpoint. This corresponds to the route in your Node.js code where the passwordCheck middleware is applied (app.use(passwordCheck)). -->
  <form action="/check" method="POST">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <!-- The name attribute is set to "password," which aligns with how the Node.js middleware accesses the password in the request body (req.body["password"]). -->

    <!-- Clicking it will trigger the form submission, and the data (including the entered password) will be sent to the "/check" endpoint. -->
