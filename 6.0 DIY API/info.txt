What makes API a good one?
- Data collection.
- Algorithm/ Service.
- Simplified interface.


build REST API (representational state transfer) -

What makes an API RESTful?

1. HTTP Methods -
that it uses standart http methods (get, post, put, patch, delete). This are the standart verbs that you use to intercact with our RESTful API.

2. Json - It should have a standart data format that it responds with.
Like the JSON format, the javaScript object notation, or xml, as response to the client.

3. Client and server - in RESTful API are completly seperated.
This architecture allows each side to be able to evolve independently without any dependency on the other side.

4. Stateless - each request from the client and server should contain all the information needed to complete the request.
So the server shoudln't be storing any sort of client side state or data between the requests.
So each single request and response can be complete without needing to know wha happen previously.
Every time the client make a request it gives all the information the server need.
This rule allows the server to serve many many clients and requests.

5. Resource-Based - It's an API that is based on resources and uses unique resource identifier, also known as a resource locator- URI or URL.


Actuallty, the internat is one of the most successful implementations of RESTful architecture.
(resources located in URL, we work with the server through HTTP methods, we get the response in JSON format/ XML, also we have strict server-client seperation.
client is who using the browser, the server is a computer that holds the data that needs to be served when somebody requests a particular web page , 
and finally the internet is stateless, every single request to a web page contains all of the information that's required in order to determine what web page to sent back).
